# owe.js

**O**bject **W**eb **E**xposer.

A Node.js/io.js wrapper for protocol independent web API exposal. owe.js is the core of the runnr.js client-server interaction layer.

owe.js dynamically builds a mutable object graph, that can be configured to automatically align to the applications internal object graph.

This second layer may then be exposed by any protocol you wish. That way API specs can be defined at the positions the data actually comes from with drastically reduced redundancy.

More detailed information soon.
